​Passivity is dangerous.  Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said, “He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”  This post attempts to explore the different forms of passivity and the consequences of inaction. 

Passiveness appears in many avenues of our lives.  We can be passive about our weight, our jobs, and our relationships.  We can also be passive about supporting our beliefs, not donating enough time and money to important causes .  Lastly, we can be passive in thought, focusing our mental energies predominately on our own busy lives.  Living and thinking within our own bubbles are the paths of least resistance.  Many of us do want change, but our ability to act is puzzlingly weak.  Very often, we convince ourselves and each other that the cost of action is high, and sometimes it is.  We all need a basic level of comfort before we have the energy to tackle something else.  Psychologists like Maslow have postulated that humans need basic levels of food, shelter, and love before they can start thinking about other needs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).  For a single mother working a few jobs to get by, she might not have the time or energy to advocate a social issue close to her heart.  For the rest of us, we need to understand the consequences of passivity and reassess our values and our time. 

Without knowing the effects of our actions, it is difficult to create a value system for those actions.  A logical corollary is that without knowing the effects of our passivity, we are blind to its consequences.  And so the first and most important action is to understand the repercussions of passiveness – we cannot be passive about this!  If being healthy is the goal, we need to learn about how our lifestyles affect our health in every way.  It is surprising how few people understand or wish to understand the detriments of looking at a computer or mobile phone screen, eating lots of meat, sleeping less than 8 hours a day, sitting at a desk for an extended period of time, and not exercising intensely (all extremely harmful).  We do not see the effects immediately, and so we passively accept our lifestyles.  We follow those around us and gradually lose the momentum to change our habits.  Of course will power is a big proponent of our decision making, but if we knew the detriments, we might behave differently.   

Information on health is becoming more prevalent, exposing the ramifications of our habits.   There is also a lot more information on social injustices, acts of altruism, crime, and environmental changes.  News sources like Vice are trying to educate the world about major issues that affect millions of people.  It is our responsibility, our benefit, and society’s benefit to understand how the world works and to make changes when needed.  Many scientific studies are exposing the impacts of passivity.  Veteran doctors often incorrectly detect heart murmurs because of the passive way they perform this repetitive task.  Voter passiveness, being uninformed about the election candidates or not voting, can lead to detrimental consequences for a district or even a nation.  There is evidence that passive investing (use of index funds like the S&P 500) cause big corporations to get bigger while limiting the growth of smaller companies, and consequently augments income inequality (http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/04/mutual_funds_make_air_travel_more_expensive_institutional_investors_reduce.html).  It is our imperative to learn and act on our beliefs and our morals.  There are many people with opposing views who relish in the fact that we are passive.  Chairman Mao famously said, “Passivity is fatal to us.  Our goal is to make the enemy passive.” One question that we should all ask ourselves: if we believe in something and do not act on it, do we really believe in it?
