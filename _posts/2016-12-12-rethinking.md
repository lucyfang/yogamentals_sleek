Humans are reactionary beings.  We use our five senses to perceive the world, and we react voluntarily and involuntarily to stimuli.  When we see a smile or laughter, our mood gets affected positively, and conversely when we see something grotesque, we get affected negatively.  It is often difficult to step back and think about these stimuli before reacting.  Growing up, we all use these stimuli to describe the world that we live in and help us learn.  We stereotype a chair as an object for sitting, and we stereotype bread as something to eat.  This method works to the extent that our experiences validate these stereotypes.  As the world and our lives become more and more complex, we also need assistance in understanding the world.  We use parents, friends, literature, and other sources of knowledge to stereotype and describe the world.  Without these methods, we do not grow and we do not learn.

This method of learning is not perfect.  It relies on a person’s sample of experiences to represent that of the world, and it relies on the moral judgment of all the sources of information available.  As the amount of information and stimuli increase in today’s world, it becomes increasingly important to be diligent when formulating an opinion, especially on another person.  This concept may sound simple, but I believe is one of the hardest to accomplish in practice.  We are all extremely engrained in a world based on only our experiences, and to take a step back and question everything that we have ever learned is incredibly difficult. 

 From a young age, kids are taught that bullies, robbers, killers, and those that commit crimes are bad.  Some deserve to go to jail and stay there to protect the rest of the population.  Kids are often taught not to commit these crimes that can land them in jail.  There is often very little education on what drives the criminals to commit those crimes, how stress and pressure can bring the negatives out of someone, and how the prison environment can create or amplify criminal tendencies.    The Stanford Prison Experiment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) gives a glimpse of what an average person can become in a stressed environment.  This 1971 experiment took college students and assigned them roles of prisoners and guards in a make-believe prison.  The result of the experiment shocked everyone, including the students themselves.  The guards gradually started to abuse their power and culminated in psychological torture of the prisoners.  The prisoners eventually succumbed to the abuse and even turned on those who tried to defy the guards.  The experiment had to be terminated after only 6 days due to the damage inflicted on everyone involved.   When looking back at the experiment, the students were shocked at what had happened and deeply ashamed of what they were capable of.

 It is difficult or even impossible to question everything that we believe.  We would cease to have opinions and cease to understand anything.  However, given the chance, we do have the responsibility to not make quick judgment, especially of other people.  Without living their lives and without having their personalities, we have very little information to make opinions.  We have the responsibility to consider all the angles before making a decision, especially one that may affect other people around the world.  It is awesomely tedious to figure out all the different angles, but it is also our responsibility not to be lazy.  In A People’s History of the United States, the author Howard Zinn quotes an explorer’s reaction to finding indigenous people: “They … brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks’ bells. They willingly traded everything they owned… . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features…. They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane… . They would make fine servants…. With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.” On the second Monday of every October, citizens of the United States celebrate this explorer’s landing in America, a national holiday called Columbus Day.
