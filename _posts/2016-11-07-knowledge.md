The biggest advantage that humans have over anything else on Earth is our intelligence.  Throughout history, humans have used their brains to control plants, animals, and other elements of nature.  We have created scientific methods to learn and experiment with everything in this universe.  Once we have knowledge about something, we have control over it.  Another side effect of knowledge is that those with knowledge also have control over those who do not.  Not only does the chemist have control over the products that he works with, but he or she also has control over everyone else in the world who knows nothing about chemicals. 

Those with knowledge have the responsibility to use that knowledge in a positive way.  People get influenced easily and that is one of the primary ways that we learn.  A newborn baby has no knowledge and must rely on his or her surroundings to gain that knowledge.  A parent, guardian, or friend becomes the source of knowledge for the baby and consequently has an immense amount of control over the baby for many years.  The parent is responsible for proper use of his knowledge to help raise a healthy child.  In society, those with knowledge have immense control over those that do not.  In Malcom Gladwell’s book “The Tipping Point”, he explains the Law of the Few (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point).  Three kinds of people have tremendous influence over the people of the world: those with many connections, those with information, and those with sales skills.  These people influence the way people dress, the way people speak, and even the way people treat others.  From the popularity of Hush Puppies to crime rates in NYC, Malcom Gladwell found that a few influencers were able to change the people’s preferences and the course of history.

Two interesting conclusions need to be made.  1) The motives of influential people are not always clear and may not always align with our views; as a result, we must not succumb to influence easily, but rather only develop an opinion after we have enough knowledge. 2) Once we have knowledge of something, we must be mindful of the immense power and use that power carefully and appropriately.

This world is extremely complex, and we all need help from experts to make decisions.  We have created governments, laws, literature, media, and many other sources of guidance.  Schools, and specifically teachers, spend hours a day guiding students through the information needed to survive.  As the students develop an understanding of the world, two important responsibilities arise.  The students have the responsibility to question all the information that they receive.  The best teachers and mentors that I have come across have an interesting phrase that has resonated with me for years: “Don’t believe everything that I say.”  We all have a very important responsibility to process the information that we intake and question it.  Believing the information blindly is lazy and irresponsible.  Regurgitating others’ opinions as our own is even more irresponsible and lazy.  As the students grow up, gain knowledge, and become influencers themselves, it is imperative that they use this knowledge appropriately.  This is far from easy, as laziness, self-interest, ego, and many other demons affect the way we influence others.  The second reasonability belongs to those with knowledge.  How we influence the world will shape the minds and architecture of the future, and being mindful of this every day is an imperative.
