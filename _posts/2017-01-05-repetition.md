​Truisms pervade our lives, appearing on Hallmark cards, posters, book titles, songs, and any medium of communication.  A combination of the frequency and pedestrian nature of the truisms and our ever waning attention spans has lessened the importance of these quotes.  Phrases like “Look before you leap” or “Never give up” are treated as educational phrases to teach elementary students, not wisdom-packed life lessons for grown adults.  Only through traumatic life experiences do we begin to appreciate these precautionary statements.  This phenomenon of overlooking unexciting concepts is a weakness of human nature and is being exploited by an explosion of information and stimuli.

In science and mathematics, formulas concisely explain difficult concepts.  We have all heard of E=mc^2 or F=ma.  These formulas are related to energy and force.  However, to excel at mechanics and to use these formulas meaningfully and creatively, the physicist must use and apply these formulas over and over again.  The repetition makes the formulas part of the user, and when he looks at the formula, he is reminded of all the experiences associated with these simple symbols.  From derivation, to application, to disagreement, to acceptance, and finally to appreciation, the physicist transforms his understanding of the formula.  At the very end, after years of use, the physicist will finally marvel at the existence of the formula.  An elementary read of the symbols gives no justice for the history that lies behind the letters. 

Understanding a concept takes time and deliberation.  When reading a book or learning a theorem, we generally do not grasp the ideas on the first take.  Deliberate repetition is the only way to gain knowledge and real experience.  This concept applies to every aspect of our lives, from learning, to practicing a sport, and to loving a significant other.  It takes humility to admit that we do not truly understand the truisms and it takes great amounts of effort to deliberately learn these wisdoms.  Our experience of the world and how we treat others depend on our mastery of concepts.  And so I give one last piece of advice: reread this blog post!
